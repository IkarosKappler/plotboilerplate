============================

How To Use The Demo
-------------------

- Drag the vertices around. You see they are in an ordered sequence, displayed as a polygon.
- Import other test data by dropping a JSON file onto the canvas.
- Export the current vertex position into a JSON array of vertices by clicking *exportJSON*.

Example data can be found in the files [star.json] or [vertices.json].


[star.json]: star.json
