/**
 * Idea:
 * 1) Find all polygons on the 'lowest' level, that do not contain any others.
 * 2) Cross them out.
 *    They are on level 0.
 * 3) Then find those which contain these and only these.
 * 4) Cross those out, too.
 * 5) They are one level above.
 * 6) Continue recursively with step 3 until none are left. This is the upper level.
